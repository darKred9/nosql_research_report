This report is for Sample Topic 1.

## Write Performance Tests

1.	Run `write_test_query.sh` to test Redis writing performance. (This script will first install Redis if itâ€™s not already installed.)
2.	Run `write_test_mongo.py` to test MongoDB writing performance.
3.	Use `write_chart.py` to generate graphs of the test results.
4.	Run `write_test_mongo_many.py` to compare the performance of insert_one() and insert_many() in MongoDB.

## Query Performance Tests

1.	Run `query_test` to test the query performance of Redis and MongoDB.
2.	Use `query_chart.py` to generate graphs of the test results.
